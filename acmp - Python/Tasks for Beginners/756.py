Fishing Net
(Time: 1 sec. Memory: 16 MB Difficulty: 10%)

Poacher Petrovich uses an illegal fishing method by deploying a fishing net.
However, large fish often tear the net, requiring frequent repairs.
One day, Petrovich wondered: **what is the maximum number of breaks**
that the fishing net can withstand without being torn into separate pieces?

The net has a **rectangular shape** of **M × N** nodes,
where all adjacent nodes are connected by fishing lines.
A **break** is defined as a single tear in the fishing line between two adjacent nodes.

For example, if the net has a size of **2 × 2**, it forms a square,
where only **one** break is allowed in any of the four possible connections.
Any two breaks would divide the net into separate parts.

### Input
The input file **INPUT.TXT** contains a single line with two integers **M** and **N**,
separated by a space, representing the dimensions of the fishing net (**1 ≤ M, N ≤ 10,000**).

### Output
The output file **OUTPUT.TXT** should contain a single integer –
the **maximum number of breaks** that can occur without splitting the net into separate parts.
